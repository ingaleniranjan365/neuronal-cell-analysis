# Neuronal Cell Image Analysis

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for analyzing fluorescent neuronal cell images. It includes:

## Features
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Binary classification using Random Forest
- Model evaluation with confusion matrix
- Probability distribution visualization
- Real-time prediction on new images

## Setup
1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python requests matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook neuronal_cell_analysis.ipynb
```

## Workflow
1. Data preparation using scikit-learn sample images
2. Image preprocessing and normalization
3. Model training using RandomForest
4. Model evaluation and visualization
5. Real-time predictions on new images

## Future Improvements
- Use larger, properly labeled dataset
- Implement sophisticated preprocessing
- Add transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Implement data augmentation
- Add cross-validation
- Add model interpretability features
